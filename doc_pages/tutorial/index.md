title: Tutorial

Here in this section we first explain the general procedure
for running the testcases and describe the general input file information.
Next we show the step by step procedure for running two very simple
and basic testcases, Euler and Maxwell, using Ateles.
Furthermore, tracking, introducing a source term, and postprocessing
with atl\_harvesting is explained and demonstrated.

We already assume that you have downloaded and compiled Ateles.
If you have not done yet, we recommend going [back](../build_and_run.html) and
completing this procedure.
