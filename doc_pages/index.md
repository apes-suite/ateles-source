Ateles is part of the APES suite and you can find an overview to the workflow
in these tools in [APES Overview](apes_overview.html).
To get you started, you might want to have a look at the
[Tutorial](tutorial/index.html).
In the main directory of Ateles you find a `ateles.lua` file which contains a
sample configuration with explanations on most settings.
You can use this as a template for your own configurations.
