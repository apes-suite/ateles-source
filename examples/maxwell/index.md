title: Maxwell Equations

This is a collection of setups for the Maxwell equations.
See the [[atl_eqn_maxwell_module]] for details on the definition of the
equation table.

The following setups illustrate the use of the Maxwell equations:

* [Periodic oscillator with P-Polynomials](periodic_oscillator_P8_3D)
* [Periodic oscillator with Q-Polynomials](periodic_oscillator_Q8_3D)
* [Scattering at a perfectly conducting object defined by a function](pec_scatter_inhomogenous_matFun_Q8_3D)
* [Scattering at a perfectly conducting object defined by a variable](pec_scatter_inhomogenous_matVar_Q8_3D)
* [Field in a rectangular wave guide](rectangular_wave_Q8_3D)
