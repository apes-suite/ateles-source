title: Perfectly_scatter_Inhomogenous_Materia

Test case description: This setup investigates the a perfectly scattered inhomogenous material, solving the maxwell equations.

This test case is tailored to check the Q-polynomial representation and a scheme order of 8. Material variables are defined 
directly in the variable table.

**Features used**

1. Projection: fpt

2. Polynomial representation: Q

3. Filtering: -- 

4. Timestepping: explicitRungeKutta, 4 steps 

5. Boundary conditions: Perfectly electric conductor 

6. Others: 
   - Derived quantity: Displacement field
