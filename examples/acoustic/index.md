title: Acoustic Equations

The acoustic equations provide the simulation of acoustic wave propagation
in an isothermal medium at rest.
For details see the [[atl_eqn_acoustic_module]].

The following setups are provided as examples:

* [A Gaussian pulse in 2D](gauss_densitypulse_2D)
* [A planar wave in 3D](planar_wave_3D)
