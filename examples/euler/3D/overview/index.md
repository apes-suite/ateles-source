title: Configuration overview for Euler 3D simulations

This setup provides an overview to the various configuration options for Euler
3D simulations.
The domain is a simple cube with periodic boundary conditions in all directions
and a Gaussian pulse is transported through the domain by a constant velocity.

The `ateles.lua` that may also be used as a template for your own
configuration:

```lua
{!examples/euler/3D/overview/ateles.lua!}
```
